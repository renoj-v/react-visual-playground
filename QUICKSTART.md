# Quick Start Guide

Get your React Visual Playground up and running in 3 simple steps:

## 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 3. Open in Browser
Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

That's it! You're ready to explore the React Bits components and context management system.

## What to Try

1. Click the different action buttons to see animations
2. Watch your interactions being tracked
3. Click "Show Context Summary" to view all captured data
4. Export your context data as JSON
5. Clear the context and start fresh

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
- Vite will automatically use the next available port (5174, 5175, etc.)
- Check the terminal output for the actual URL

**Build errors?**
- Make sure you're using Node.js v18 or higher
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again

## Next Steps

- Explore the component files in [src/components/](src/components/)
- Customize the animations and styles
- Add your own React Bits components from [reactbits.dev](https://reactbits.dev)
- Modify the context tracking to suit your needs
